I know longer use this as my homepage. Jamarr.me is currently a tumblr blog,
while I continue development of my new site!

 The site design and code is based on a lifehacker article
http://lifehacker.com/5946783/roll-your-own-perfectly+organized-printable-online-resume-in-five-minutes
Thanks to Adam Dachis, And Lifehacker.
I am also working on a new design for the site which will replace this repo soon. More news to come!
